### 2048 Game using Reinforcement Learning

##### 2048 game is implemented using reinforcement learning methods using DQN algorithm

##### Functional Requirements

###### 1. Python

###### 2. Keras

###### 3. Open AI Gym

##### Steps

###### Player starts playing the 2048 game.

###### Screen displays with 4x4 grid where initially it has 2 number displayed in random.

###### Initial score when the player start is 0 and move is 1.

###### R is pressed to restart the game and Q is for quitting the game.

###### As the player continues to play, the score and moves is updated.

###### And another approach is agent playing the game and evaluating the observations and probabilities.
